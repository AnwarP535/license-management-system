# Frontend API Configuration
# This is the base URL for the backend API
# 
# For docker-compose setup:
#   - Use http://localhost:8080 (backend is exposed on host port 8080)
#   - Or use http://backend:8080 (internal docker network, but won't work in browser)
#
# For local development:
#   - Use http://localhost:8080 (when backend runs locally)
#
# For production:
#   - Update this to your production backend URL
#   - Example: https://api.yourdomain.com
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Note: Vite requires the VITE_ prefix for environment variables to be exposed to the client
# These variables are embedded at build time, not runtime
